"""CASSANDRA-16902: A user should be able to view permissions of a role they created.

JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16902
Buggy: cassandra 4.0.1  ->  Fixed: cassandra 4.0.2 (also 3.0.26 / 3.11.12 / 4.1-alpha1 / 4.1).
Component: Feature/Authorization. (Sibling of CASSANDRA-16977, fixed in the same 4.0.2 release.)

Reproduction summary (single auth-enabled node, with PasswordAuthenticator + CassandraAuthorizer):
  When a role creates another role it should, by default, receive the DESCRIBE permission on the
  newly created role. In 4.0.1 that auto-grant-on-create is missing, so the (non-superuser)
  creating role cannot view the permissions of the role it just created. Concretely, as the
  superuser create a non-superuser `parent` with CREATE ON ALL ROLES, then in a SEPARATE
  authenticated session as `parent` create a `child` role and run LIST ALL PERMISSIONS OF 'child'.
  On the buggy 4.0.1 build that LIST is rejected with code=2100 [Unauthorized]; on the fixed 4.0.2
  build the same non-superuser `parent` can list the permissions of the `child` it created.

Verbatim buggy signature (from the reproduction evidence log, cassandra:4.0.1):
  <stdin>:1:Unauthorized: Error from server: code=2100 [Unauthorized] message="You are not authorized to view child's permissions"

NOTE on shape / encoding (read before changing this file):
  * CONFIG-GATED: the bug only manifests with CassandraAuthorizer enabled. With the operator's
    default AllowAllAuthorizer, LIST ALL PERMISSIONS is effectively a no-op and the missing
    default DESCRIBE grant is masked. post_deploy() therefore patches the operator-managed
    K8ssandraCluster CR's cassandraYaml block to set authenticator=PasswordAuthenticator and
    authorizer=CassandraAuthorizer (CassandraAuthorizer with AllowAllAuthenticator is a config
    error that blocks startup, so the authenticator must be set alongside the authorizer), then
    waits for the operator-driven rolling restart. A direct pod/StatefulSet edit would be reverted
    by the operator on the next reconcile, so the change must be at the CR level. Mirrors the
    sibling encoding in auto_cassandra_16977.py.
  * TWO AUTHENTICATED SESSIONS (inherent to this bug): the reproduction requires a NON-superuser
    `parent` to LIST permissions of a role it created — i.e. two distinct identities. The shared
    Cassandra reproducer plumbing in sregym/service/db_build_spec.py
    (`_cassandra_run_reproducer` / `_cassandra_reproducer_workload`) connects with a single bare,
    UNAUTHENTICATED `cqlsh <svc>` and runs one anonymous script; it can express neither the auth
    gating nor the superuser-then-parent session split. So inject_fault() is overridden to run the
    two sessions explicitly via `kubectl exec` (session A as the operator-generated superuser read
    from the `<cluster>-superuser` secret; session B as `parent`), following the kubectl-exec
    pattern in cassandra_20108.py / auto_cassandra_16977.py. The superuser is NOT cassandra/cassandra
    — the K8ssandra operator generates a random superuser and disables the default login — so the
    credentials are read from the secret rather than hardcoded. The `parent` password ('x') is
    hardcoded because this code creates the `parent` role with that password itself.
  * continuous_reproducer = False (diagnosis-only oracle): this is an auth-gated, two-session,
    error-producing bug with no expected_output. A looping continuous-reproducer pod uses the
    shared bare/unauthenticated single-script probe (no `-u/-p`, one identity), which under the
    enabled PasswordAuthenticator cannot even connect and cannot perform the two-session flow, so
    it would report NotReady forever and could never detect a fix. A perpetually-broken mitigation
    oracle is worse than none, so this problem is graded by the diagnosis oracle only (the same
    choice CassandraBugProblem makes). Recorded loudly per the skill's "reproducer validation is
    narrow" gotcha.

            and the two-session (superuser vs. parent) flow needs distinct logins;

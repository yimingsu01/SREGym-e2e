"""CASSANDRA-16898: the clustering order logic in materialized view creation changed in 4.0.

JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16898
Buggy: cassandra 4.0.1  ->  Fixed: cassandra 4.0.2
Component: Feature/Materialized Views

Before 4.0, when a materialized view was created with no CLUSTERING ORDER specified, the
view's inherited clustering columns took the base table's clustering order. In 4.0 this
behaviour regressed: the clustering order was defaulted to ASC for all columns instead of
inheriting the base table order.

Reproduction (single node, RF=1, MVs enabled via cassandra.yaml):
  Create a base table whose clustering column ck is ordered DESC
  (WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (ck DESC)), then CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW on it WITHOUT a
  WITH CLUSTERING ORDER clause, keeping ck as a clustering column (PRIMARY KEY (pk, v, ck)).
  On 4.0.1 the MV's inherited clustering column ck defaults to ASC instead of DESC.

This is a WRONG-RESULT / silent schema-correctness bug — CREATE succeeds (only a benign
"Materialized views are experimental" warning), but the persisted clustering order is wrong.

Verbatim buggy signature (DESCRIBE MATERIALIZED VIEW repro16898ks.mv on 4.0.1):
    WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (v ASC, ck ASC)
and system_schema.columns shows the inherited clustering column row: ck | clustering | 1 | asc
(the base table's ck is DESC, so ck should be DESC in the MV — the 4.0.2 control prints
"WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (v ASC, ck DESC)" / ck | clustering | 1 | desc). v stays ASC on both
builds because v was a regular column in the base table (no clustering order to inherit), so the
only column that flips is the inherited clustering column ck.

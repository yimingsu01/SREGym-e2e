"""CASSANDRA-18760: Backport CASSANDRA-16905 — type-incompatible re-add of a dropped column is not blocked.

Title: Backport CASSANDRA-16905 to older branches
JIRA:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-18760

Buggy: cassandra 4.0.11   Fixed: cassandra 4.0.12 (also 3.0.30, 3.11.16)

Reproduction (single node; schema + a local sstable, no ring divergence needed):
  1. CREATE a table with a `col1 map<int, tinyint>` column and INSERT map cells with a
     far-future write timestamp (USING TIMESTAMP 9223372036854775000). The far-future
     timestamp defeats DROP read-shadowing so the cells physically survive the later DROP
     and are read back under the re-added column.
  2. `nodetool flush` — flush the map cells to an sstable so they survive on disk (load-bearing:
     the bug surfaces when the surviving on-disk complex/map cells are read under the new
     simple/blob column).
  3. `ALTER TABLE ... DROP col1;` then `ALTER TABLE ... ADD col1 blob;`. On 4.0.11 the
     type-incompatible map->blob re-add SUCCEEDS (the CASSANDRA-16905 guardrail is missing),
     leaving a contradictory schema: col1 is live as `blob` while system_schema.dropped_columns
     still records col1 as `map<int, tinyint>`.
  4. `SELECT *` reads the surviving complex/map cells under the simple/blob column and fails
     server-side; the client sees a ReadFailure (code=1300).

The fixed image (4.0.12) BLOCKS step 3's `ADD col1 blob` at ALTER time with
`InvalidRequest ... Cannot re-add previously dropped column 'col1' of type blob, incompatible
with previous type map<int, tinyint>`, so the corrupt-schema state is never created.

*** VERBATIM BUGGY SIGNATURE *** (server-side, from `kubectl logs`):
  ERROR [ReadStage-13] ... AbstractLocalAwareExecutorService.java:169 - Uncaught exception on thread Thread[ReadStage-13,10,main]
  java.lang.AssertionError: col1
      at org.apache.cassandra.db.rows.UnfilteredSerializer.lambda$serializeRowBody$0(UnfilteredSerializer.java:244)
      at org.apache.cassandra.db.rows.UnfilteredSerializer.serializeRowBody(UnfilteredSerializer.java:237)
      at org.apache.cassandra.db.rows.UnfilteredSerializer.serialize(UnfilteredSerializer.java:205)

Shape: nodetool/flush sequence (not pure CQL). The load-bearing `nodetool flush` cannot run
through the cqlsh-only run_reproducer, so inject_fault() is overridden to kubectl-exec the CQL
setup, flush every node, run the schema ALTERs, then fire the failing SELECT (the 17136/20108
pattern).

continuous_reproducer is intentionally False (diagnosis-only). Per this bug's reproduction
evidence log, `SELECT *` returns a ReadFailure on BOTH the buggy (4.0.11) and the fixed (4.0.12)
node — the far-future-timestamp map cell physically survives the DROP on both, so a fixed node
ALSO throws on the read (a benign IllegalStateException at Columns.java:593, vs the buggy
AssertionError at UnfilteredSerializer.java:244). The cassandra continuous-reproducer probe only
checks the cqlsh exit code, which is non-zero on BOTH versions, so it could never signal "fixed":
a mitigation oracle here would be silently broken. The real discriminator (the ALTER ADD being
allowed vs rejected) is one-shot/stateful and the buggy-vs-fixed signal is server-log-only —
invisible to a client cqlsh probe. A diagnosis-only oracle (matching cassandra_20108 / auto
17136) is the correct, honest choice.

"""Materialized views: incorrect quoting of a mixed-case UDF in the stored WHERE clause.

JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16836
Buggy: cassandra 3.11.11  ->  Fixed: cassandra 3.11.12 (also 4.1-alpha1 / 4.1).

Reproduction (single node, RF=1, UDFs enabled via cassandra.yaml):
  Create a table, a UDF whose name needs quoting because it is mixed-case ("Double"),
  and a materialized view whose WHERE clause references it: WHERE k < ks."Double"(2).
  The MV's WHERE clause is persisted/regenerated WITHOUT the quotes (as ks.Double(2)).
  The first INSERT into the base table triggers MV maintenance, which re-parses that
  stored WHERE clause; the unquoted Double is lowercased to ks.double, which does not
  exist, so the local mutation that maintains the MV fails.

Client surface (cqlsh):
  WriteFailure: Error from server: code=1500 [Replica(s) failed to execute write]
Server-side root exception (verbatim signature from system.log on cassandra:3.11.11):
  org.apache.cassandra.exceptions.InvalidRequestException: Unknown function repro16836.double called

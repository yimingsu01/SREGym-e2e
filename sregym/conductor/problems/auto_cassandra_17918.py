"""CASSANDRA-17918: DESCRIBE output does not quote column names using reserved keywords.

JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-17918
Buggy: 4.1.1   Fixed: 4.1.2 (also 4.0.10, 5.0-alpha1, 5.0)
Fix commit: 75194201f1f06d120f246f6fad025ca5f672943d

Reproduction (single node, pure CQL):
  Create a UDT whose field names are reserved keywords ("token", "desc"), then run
  DESCRIBE TYPE. On 4.1.1 the field names are emitted UNQUOTED, so feeding the DESCRIBE
  output back as a CREATE TYPE fails to re-import (SyntaxException). On 4.1.2 the same
  field names are correctly emitted quoted ("token" / "desc") and round-trip cleanly.

This is a WRONG-RESULT bug: DESCRIBE TYPE returns an incorrect value rather than raising.
The buggy DESCRIBE output emits the reserved keyword field name without quotes, e.g.
(verbatim buggy signature; control 4.1.2 emits `    "token" text,`):

    token text,

Root cause: src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/marshal/UserType.java — UserType.toCqlString()
(reached via SchemaElement.toCqlString for DESCRIBE TYPE) appended UDT field names with
plain `builder.append(fieldNameAsString(i))` instead of `builder.appendQuotingIfNeeded(...)`,
so field names that are reserved keywords are not quoted in the emitted CREATE TYPE.

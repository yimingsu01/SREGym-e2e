"""CASSANDRA-20972: SELECT DISTINCT over a flushed range tombstone throws IllegalStateException.

Title: SELECT DISTINCT + range tombstone IllegalStateException (UnfilteredRowIterator not closed).
JIRA:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-20972

Buggy: 5.0.5   ->   Fixed: 5.0.6

Reproduction (single node, requires a `nodetool flush` so the data lands in an SSTable):
  1. Create keyspace k (RF=1) and table k.tbl with PRIMARY KEY (id, ck).
  2. Write a range tombstone (DELETE ... WHERE id=1 AND ck<10) then INSERT a live row (id=1, ck=5).
  3. `nodetool flush k tbl` — forces the range tombstone + row into a Big-format SSTable.
  4. SELECT DISTINCT id FROM k.tbl WHERE token(id) > -9223372036854775808 — fails on the buggy build.

On 5.0.5 the SELECT DISTINCT path over the SSTable reuses the partition's UnfilteredRowIterator
without closing it, so the next hasNext()/next() on the BigTableScanner trips an internal guard.

VERBATIM BUGGY SIGNATURE (5.0.5):
  ReadFailure; server log: IllegalStateException: The UnfilteredRowIterator ... must be closed
  before calling hasNext() or next() again  at SSTableScanner.java:241

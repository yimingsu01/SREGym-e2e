"""Capital `P` confused for a Duration in the CQL parser where IDENT is expected.

JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-17919
Component: CQL / Syntax
Buggy: 4.1.1   Fixed: 3.11.15, 4.0.10, 4.1.2, 5.0-alpha1, 5.0

Reproduction (single node, pure CQL): issue a CQL statement that uses a bare
(unquoted) capital `P` where the grammar expects a plain identifier — e.g.
`CREATE TABLE P (k INT PRIMARY KEY)`. On the buggy 4.1.1 build the lexer mis-treats
`P` as the leading designator of an ISO-8601 Duration literal (P1Y2M...), so it
cannot be consumed as an identifier and the parse fails. Lowercase `p` is
unaffected, and the identical statement parses fine on fixed 4.1.2.

Verbatim buggy signature:
  SyntaxException: line 1:13 no viable alternative at input 'P' (CREATE TABLE [P]...)

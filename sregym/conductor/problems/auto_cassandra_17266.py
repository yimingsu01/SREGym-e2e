"""CASSANDRA-17266: DESCRIBE MATERIALIZED VIEW emits invalid CQL (default_time_to_live = 0).

JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-17266
Title: DESCRIBE KEYSPACE / MATERIALIZED VIEW generates invalid CQL for views.

Buggy: 4.0.3  ->  Fixed: 4.0.4 (also 4.1-alpha1 / 4.1). Components: CQL/Syntax.

Reproduction summary (single node, server-side DESCRIBE generation):
  1. Materialized views must be enabled first (`enable_materialized_views: true` in
     cassandra.yaml — off by default in 4.0.x). post_deploy() patches the K8ssandraCluster CR.
  2. CREATE TABLE with `default_time_to_live = 60`, then CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW over it
     with NO TTL option (MVs forbid the option per CASSANDRA-12868).
  3. DESCRIBE MATERIALIZED VIEW wrongly emits `AND default_time_to_live = 0` inside the
     CREATE block. Replaying that DESCRIBE output to re-create the view is rejected by the
     server. The defect is in DESCRIBE output generation, NOT in the validation that rejects
     the option (the rejecting validation exists in both 4.0.3 and 4.0.4); the discriminator
     is the presence/absence of the `default_time_to_live` line in DESCRIBE output.

This is a WRONG-OUTPUT bug, so expected_output is set to the BUGGY value the buggy build
emits (`default_time_to_live = 0`). The reproducer-pod readiness probe greps DESCRIBE output
for it: Ready = bug present (line emitted on 4.0.3), Not Ready = fixed (line absent on 4.0.4).

Verbatim buggy signature (from the DESCRIBE MATERIALIZED VIEW output on 4.0.3):
    AND default_time_to_live = 0                <-- BUG: invalid for an MV
Corroboration: replaying the buggy DESCRIBE output fails with
    InvalidRequest: Error from server: code=2200 [Invalid query] message="Cannot set
    default_time_to_live for a materialized view. Data in a materialized view always expire
    at the same time than the corresponding data in the parent table."

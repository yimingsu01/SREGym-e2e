"""CASSANDRA-16977: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in FunctionResource#fromName.

JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16977
Buggy: cassandra 4.0.1  ->  Fixed: cassandra 4.0.2 (also 3.0.26 / 3.11.12 / 4.1-alpha1 / 4.1).
Component: Feature/Authorization.

Reproduction summary (single auth-enabled node, RF=1, with CassandraAuthorizer + UDFs):
  On a node with PasswordAuthenticator + CassandraAuthorizer and user-defined functions
  enabled, create a ZERO-ARG UDF, then GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION ks.fn() TO a role. The
  GRANT itself SUCCEEDS -- it writes the authorization resource string `functions/ks/fn[]`.
  The bug fires on the READ path: `LIST ALL PERMISSIONS OF <role>` makes
  CassandraAuthorizer.listPermissionsForRole parse that stored resource back via
  Resources.fromName -> FunctionResource.fromName, which splits `fn[]` into a length-1
  array `["fn"]` and then indexes nameAndArgs[1], throwing ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
  Client (cqlsh) sees NoHostAvailable; the server logs the AIOOBE below.

Verbatim buggy signature (from the reproduction evidence log, cassandra:4.0.1 system.log):
  java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 1 out of bounds for length 1
      at org.apache.cassandra.auth.FunctionResource.fromName(FunctionResource.java:190)
      at org.apache.cassandra.auth.Resources.fromName(Resources.java:60)
      at org.apache.cassandra.auth.CassandraAuthorizer.listPermissionsForRole(CassandraAuthorizer.java:282)
      at org.apache.cassandra.auth.CassandraAuthorizer.list(CassandraAuthorizer.java:262)
      at org.apache.cassandra.cql3.statements.ListPermissionsStatement.list(ListPermissionsStatement.java:112)
(The Jira description cites FunctionResource.java:178; the 4.0.1 build throws at line 190 --
same method, same code, only a line-number drift across branches.)

NOTE on auth / reproducer plumbing (framework limitation, NOT a defect in this encoding):
  This bug only manifests with CassandraAuthorizer enabled, which forces the auth stack on
  (PasswordAuthenticator). post_deploy() below sets authenticator/authorizer/UDF in the
  operator-managed cassandraYaml so the cluster comes up with the required configuration.
  However, the SHARED Cassandra reproducer plumbing in sregym/service/db_build_spec.py
  (`_cassandra_run_reproducer` and `_cassandra_reproducer_workload`) connects with a bare
  `cqlsh <svc>` and does NOT pass `-u cassandra -p cassandra`; under the enabled
  authenticator those connections are rejected with AuthenticationFailed. This is a
  framework-wide limitation affecting every auth-gated Cassandra problem (see also
  auto_cassandra_19749). It is inherent here because the bug REQUIRES CassandraAuthorizer
  (hence authentication), so the mitigation probe -- which also uses bare cqlsh -- cannot
  currently distinguish bug-present from fixed. Fixing the shared helpers to pass
  credentials is out of scope for this code-generation task and cannot be statically
  verified. Recorded loudly per the skill's "reproducer validation is narrow" gotcha. The
  bug itself is correctly encoded below as a single-node, auth+UDF-gated crash reproducer.

        This bug requires three cassandra.yaml startup settings that are NOT CQL- or
        runtime-settable:
          * authenticator: PasswordAuthenticator  -- LIST PERMISSIONS needs an authenticated session;
          * authorizer:    CassandraAuthorizer     -- only this authorizer routes through
            CassandraAuthorizer.listPermissionsForRole, which parses the stored resource and trips
            the AIOOBE (the operator's default AllowAllAuthorizer makes LIST PERMISSIONS a no-op and
            never reaches FunctionResource.fromName);
          * enable_user_defined_functions: true    -- UDFs are disabled by default, so CREATE FUNCTION
            (and thus the zero-arg function whose resource string trips the bug) would be rejected.

        All three are set explicitly (per the reproduction evidence log) so the cluster comes up with
        the required configuration under either operator default -- in particular, CassandraAuthorizer
        with AllowAllAuthenticator is a config-validation error that would prevent startup, so
        PasswordAuthenticator must be set alongside the authorizer. We patch the operator-managed
        K8ssandraCluster CR's cassandraYaml block (a direct pod/StatefulSet edit would be reverted by
        the operator on the next reconcile) and let the operator perform a rolling restart.

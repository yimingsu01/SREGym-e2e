"""CASSANDRA-13874: nodetool setcachecapacity silently no-ops when the row cache is disabled.

JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-13874

Title: nodetool setcachecapacity behaves oddly when cache disabled.

Buggy versions (empirically confirmed in this repo's reproduction log): 4.0.0 and 4.0.1.
First fixed build: 4.0.2 (the fix guard is ABSENT from the shipped apache-cassandra-4.0.0.jar
and apache-cassandra-4.0.1.jar and first PRESENT in 4.0.2 per a bytecode contrast on
NopCacheProvider$NopCache.class). NOTE: Jira lists fixVersion 4.0.1, but the 4.0.1 Docker
image does NOT actually contain the fix — the commit landed in a later 4.0.x build (4.0.2).
Other fixVersions: 3.11.12, 4.1-alpha1, 4.1.

Reproduction (single node, stock config — row cache is disabled by default,
row_cache_size_in_mb=0, so no cassandra.yaml override is needed):
  1. Boot stock cassandra:4.0.0 (row cache disabled at startup, capacity 0 MBs).
  2. Run `nodetool setcachecapacity 200 50 50` (key=200MB, row=50MB, counter=50MB),
     asking to enable a 50 MB row cache.
  3. The command exits 0 with NO error and NO stderr; `nodetool info` shows Key Cache and
     Counter Cache capacities DID update (49->200 MiB and 24->50 MiB) while the Row Cache
     capacity SILENTLY stays at 0 bytes — the requested row cache is never enabled and no
     error is raised. This is a wrong-result/silent-no-op bug observed via `nodetool info`,
     not a query-time exception.

Verbatim buggy signature (the wrong-result `nodetool info` line after
`nodetool setcachecapacity 200 50 50` returned EXIT 0 with empty stderr):

  Row Cache              : entries 0, size 0 bytes, capacity 0 bytes, 0 hits, 0 requests, NaN recent hit rate, 0 save period in seconds
